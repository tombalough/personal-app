This is a personal website where I play with web technologies and publish projects.

## Set up

1. Run the following command to build the react application and serve it with hot module reloading:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Navigate to `<ip>:<port>` default: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view my website.


## Deploying to Github Pages

That's it.
